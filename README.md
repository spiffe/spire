# SPIFFE Reference Implementation (SRI)

The SPIFFE Reference Implementation provides a toolchain that defines a central registry of
SPIFFE IDs (the Control Plane), and a Node Agent that can be run adjacent to a workload and
exposes a local Workload API.

## Buiilding the SRI

The script `build.sh` manages the build process and can be used for development. It expects
this repo to be present at and to be run from `$GOPATH/src/github.com/spiffe/sri`.

`build.sh setup` will download and install necessary dependancies (including golang)
into the directory `.build/`

`deps` processes the `glide.lock` file

`protobuf` will regenerate the gRPC pb.go and README.md files 

`binaries` will build the main binary and the plugins

`test` will run the tests

`clean` remove built binaries and 

`distclean` remove built binaries as well as the `.build` directory

`build.sh` with no options will list available functions

`eval $(build.sh env)` will configure GOPATH, GOROOT and PATH for development outside
of `build.sh`

## Prerequisites

* The Go compiler and tools from https://golang.org/
* protoc from https://github.com/google/protobuf

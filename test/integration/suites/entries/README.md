# Registration Entries Suite

This suites verifies:

* Registration entry propagation to agents via node aliases.
* Registration entry via join token "alias".
* Registration entry update propagation.

The test can optionally be run via the `events-based-entries` suite, which will run the same
tests but with the events based cache enabled.

    # The old SPIRE server does not have the tuned up rotation check intervals
    # and can therefore not rotate the server SVID when the interval is small,
    # causing the agent to fail the TLS handshake during bootstrapping and
    # needs to be allowed to restart on failure. Once the "old" version has the
    # tuned up rotation check interval, we can remove this restart policy.

# Agent plugin: WorkloadAttestor "k8s"

The `k8s` plugin generates kubernetes-based selectors for workloads calling the agent.
It does so by retrieving the workload's pod ID from its cgroup membership, then querying
the kubelet for information about the pod.

| Configuration | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| kubelet_read_only_port | The port on which the kubelet has exposed its read-only API. |

| Selector | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| k8s:ns | The workload's namespace |
| k8s:sa | The workload's service account |

# Server plugin: UpstreamAuthority "cert-manager"

The `cert-manager` plugin uses an instance of
[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io) running in Kubernetes to to request
intermediate signing certificates for SPIRE Server.

This plugin will request a signing certificate from cert-manager via a
[CertificateRequest](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/certificaterequest/)
resource. Once the referenced issuer has signed the request, the intermediate
and CA bundle is retrieved by SPIRE.

# Considerations
This plugin requires access to a Kubernetes cluster running cert-manager and
create CertificateRequests.

Only issuers that have support for providing signing certificates are supported.

# Permissions

The provided kubeconfig must include a Kubernetes client that has
[create permissions for CertificateRequests](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/certificaterequest/)
in the configured namespace. Care should be taken as to what the identity of the
Kubernetes client is, as this may have implications on the [approval
flow](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/certificaterequest/#userinfo)
if running a custom approver.

# Configuration
This plugin requests certificates from the configured
[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/) issuer.

| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| kube_config_file          | (Optional) Path to the kubeconfig used to connect to the Kubernetes cluster. Empty path will attempt to use an in-cluster config. |
| namespace                 | The namespace to create CertificateRequests for signing.          |
| issuer_name               | The name of the issuer to reference in CertificateRequests.       |
| issuer_kind               | (Optional) The kind of the issuer to reference in CertificateRequests. Defaults to "Issuer" if empty. |
| issuer_group              | (Optional) The group of the issuer to reference in CertificateRequests. Defaults to "cert-manager.io" if empty. |

# Server plugin: UpstreamAuthority "ejbca"

The `ejbca` UpstreamAuthority plugin uses a connected [EJBCA](https://www.ejbca.org/) to issue intermediate signing certificates for the SPIRE server. The plugin authenticates to EJBCA using mTLS (client certificate).

> The EJBCA UpstreamAuthority plugin uses only the `/ejbca-rest-api/v1/certificate/pkcs10enroll` REST API endpoint, and is compatible with both [EJBCA Community](https://www.ejbca.org/) and [EJBCA Enterprise](https://www.keyfactor.com/products/ejbca-enterprise/).

## Requirements

* EJBCA [Community](https://www.ejbca.org/) or EJBCA [Enterprise](https://www.keyfactor.com/products/ejbca-enterprise/)
  * The "REST Certificate Management" protocol must be enabled under System Configuration > Protocol Configuration.

> It's important that the EJBCA Certificate Profile and End Entity Profile are properly configured before using this plugin. The plugin does not attempt to configure these profiles. Please refer to the [EJBCA Sub CA End Entity Profile & Certificate Profile Configuration](#ejbca-sub-ca-end-entity-profile--certificate-profile-configuration) section for more information.

## Configuration

The EJBCA UpstreamAuthority Plugin accepts the following configuration options.

## EJBCA Sub CA End Entity Profile & Certificate Profile Configuration

The connected EJBCA instance must have at least one Certificate Profile and at least one End Entity Profile capable of issuing SPIFFE certificates. The Certificate Profile must be of type `Sub CA`, and must be able to issue certificates with the ECDSA prime256v1 algorithm, at a minimum. The SPIRE Server configuration may require additional fields.

The End Entity Profile must have the following Subject DN Attributes:

* `serialNumber, Serial number (in DN)` [modifiable]
* `O, Organization` [modifiable]
* `C, Country (ISO 3166)` [modifiable]

And the following Other Subject Attributes:

* `Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)` [modifiable]

## EJBCA End Entity Name Customization (leaf certificates)

The EJBCA UpstreamAuthority plugin allows users to determine how the End Entity Name is selected at runtime. Here are the options you can use for `end_entity_name`:

* **`cn`:** Uses the Common Name from the CSR's Distinguished Name.
* **`dns`:** Uses the first DNS Name from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).
* **`uri`:** Uses the first URI from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).
* **`ip`:** Uses the first IP Address from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).
* **Custom Value:** Any other string will be directly used as the End Entity Name.

By default, SPIRE issues certificates with no DN and only the SPIFFE ID in the SANs. If you want to use the SPIFFE ID as the End Entity Name, you can usually leave this field blank or set it to `uri`.

If the endEntityName field is not explicitly set, the EJBCA UpstreamAuthority plugin will attempt to determine the End Entity Name using the following default behavior:

* **First, it will try to use the Common Name:** It looks at the Common Name from the CSR's Distinguished Name.
* **If the Common Name is not available, it will use the first DNS Name:** It looks at the first DNS Name from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).
* **If the DNS Name is not available, it will use the first URI:** It looks at the first URI from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).
* **If the URI is not available, it will use the first IP Address:** It looks at the first IP Address from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).
* **If none of the above are available, it will return an error.**

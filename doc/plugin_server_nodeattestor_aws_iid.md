# Server plugin: NodeAttestor "aws_iid"

*Must be used in conjunction with the agent-side aws_iid plugin*

The `aws_iid` plugin automatically attests instances using the AWS Instance
Metadata API and the AWS Instance Identity document. It also allows an operator
to use AWS Instance IDs when defining SPIFFE ID attestation policies. Agents
attested by the aws_iid attestor will be issued a SPIFFE ID like
`spiffe://example.org/spire/agent/aws_iid/ACCOUNT_ID/REGION/INSTANCE_ID`. Additionally,
this plugin resolves the agent's AWS IID-based SPIFFE ID into a set of selectors.

## Configuration

| Configuration                        | Description                                                                                                                                                   | Default                                               |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `access_key_id`                      | AWS access key id                                                                                                                                             | Value of `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variable     |
| `secret_access_key`                  | AWS secret access key                                                                                                                                         | Value of `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable |
| `skip_block_device`                  | Skip anti-tampering mechanism which checks to make sure that the underlying root volume has not been detached prior to attestation.                           | false                                                 |
| `disable_instance_profile_selectors` | Disables retrieving the attesting instance profile information that is used in the selectors. Useful in cases where the server cannot reach iam.amazonaws.com | false                                                 |
| `assume_role`                        | The role to assume                                                                                                                                            | Empty string, Optional parameter.                     |

A sample configuration:

```hcl
    NodeAttestor "aws_iid" {
        plugin_data {
            access_key_id = "ACCESS_KEY_ID"
            secret_access_key = "SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
        }
    }
```

If `assume_role` is set, the spire server will assume the role as specified by the template `arn:aws:iam::{{AccountID}}:role/{{AssumeRole}}` where `AccountID` is taken from the AWS IID document sent by the spire agent to the spire server and `AssumeRole` comes from the AWS NodeAttestor plugin configuration.

In the following configuration,

```hcl
    NodeAttestor "aws_iid" {
        plugin_data {
            assume_role = "spire-server-delegate"
        }
    }
```

assuming AWS IID document sent from the spire agent contains `accountId : 12345678`, the spire server will assume "arn:aws:iam::12345678:role/spire-server-delegate" role before making any AWS call for the node attestation. If `assume_role` is configured, the spire server will always assume the role even if the both the spire-server and the spire agent is deployed in the same account.

## Disabling Instance Profile Selectors

In cases where spire-server is running in a location with no public internet access available, setting `disable_instance_profile_selectors = true` will prevent the server from making requests to `iam.amazonaws.com`. This is needed as spire-server will fail to attest nodes as it cannot retrieve the metadata information.

When this is enabled, `IAM Role` selector information will no longer be available for use.

## AWS IAM Permissions

The user or role identified by the configured credentials must have permissions for `ec2:DescribeInstances`.

The following is an example for a IAM policy needed to get instance's info from AWS.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "iam:GetInstanceProfile"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Supported Selectors

This plugin generates the following selectors related to the instance where the agent is running:

| Selector            | Example                                               | Description                                                      |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Availability Zone   | `aws_iid:az:us-west-2b`                               | The Availability Zone in which the instance is running.          |
| IAM role            | `aws_iid:iamrole:arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/Blog` | An IAM role within the instance profile for the instance         |
| Image ID            | `aws_iid:image:id:ami-5fb8c835`                       | The ID of the AMI used to launch the instance.                   |
| Instance ID         | `aws_iid:instance:id:i-0b22a22eec53b9321`             | The ID of the instance.                                          |
| Instance Tag        | `aws_iid:tag:name:blog`                               | The key (e.g. `name`) and value (e.g. `blog`) of an instance tag |
| Region              | `aws_iid:region:us-west-2`                            | The Region in which the instance is running.                     |
| Security Group ID   | `aws_iid:sg:id:sg-01234567`                           | The id of the security group the instance belongs to             |
| Security Group Name | `aws_iid:sg:name:blog`                                | The name of the security group the instance belongs to           |

All of the selectors have the type `aws_iid`.

The `IAM role` selector is included in the generated set of selectors only if the instance has an IAM Instance Profile associated and `disable_instance_profile_selectors = false`

## Security Considerations

The AWS Instance Identity Document, which this attestor leverages to prove node identity, is available to any process running on the node by default. As a result, it is possible for non-agent code running on a node to attest to the SPIRE Server, allowing it to obtain any workload identity that the node is authorized to run.

While many operators choose to configure their systems to block access to the Instance Identity Document, the SPIRE project cannot guarantee this posture. To mitigate the associated risk, the `aws_iid` node attestor implements Trust On First Use (or TOFU) semantics. For any given node, attestation may occur only once. Subsequent attestation attempts will be rejected.

It is still possible for non-agent code to complete node attestation before SPIRE Agent can, however this condition is easily and quickly detectable as SPIRE Agent will fail to start, and both SPIRE Agent and SPIRE Server will log the occurrence. Such cases should be investigated as possible security incidents.

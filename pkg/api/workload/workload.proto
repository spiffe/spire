A workload uses this API to retrieve a list of identities that it should be allowed
to represent itself as (SPIFFE IDs) as well as, optionally, documents (in the form of
SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Documents (SVID) ) that can be used to prove those identities to other systems.

Finally, the API can also be used to retrieve trust bundles that can be used to
verify SVIDs from other SPIFFE-identified workloads.
